# Annual-Sales-Report
To create my sales report, I first imported the data from my ecommerce store into Excel. I then used pivot tables to analyze the data and create charts and graphs.
I conducted the following analyses:
Gender-wise purchasing of products in a year: This analysis showed that women made more purchases than men. This information could be used to target marketing campaigns more effectively.
Number of orders made by each age group: This analysis showed that the majority of orders were made by adults. This information could be used to develop products and marketing campaigns that appeal to this demographic.
State with the highest number of sale amount month wise: This analysis showed that California had the highest number of sales in January. This information could be used to allocate marketing resources more effectively.
Order status of each order annually and month wise: This analysis showed that the majority of orders were shipped on time. This information could be used to improve customer satisfaction.
Contribution of each store to the total sales month wise: This analysis showed that the online store had the highest contribution to sales in March. This information could be used to make decisions about store locations.
I was able to create a comprehensive and informative sales report using Excel. This report has helped me to identify trends, make informed decisions, and improve my overall business performance.
